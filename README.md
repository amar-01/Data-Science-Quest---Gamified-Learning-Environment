# Data Science Quest - Gamified Learning Environment

## Overview

Data Science Quest is an interactive, gamified web application designed to make learning data science concepts more engaging and motivating. This project transforms a standard list of data science experiments into a rewarding RPG-style quest system with progress tracking, achievements, and visual feedback.

## Features

- 🎮 **Gamified Learning**: Complete data science "quests" to earn XP and level up  
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar shows your completion percentage  
- 🏆 **Achievement System**: Unlock badges for completing milestones  
- 💾 **Persistence**: Your progress is automatically saved in your browser  
- 🎉 **Celebration Effects**: Confetti animations reward your accomplishments  
- 💪 **Motivational Quotes**: Encouraging messages keep you motivated  

## Quests Included

The application includes 10 data science experiments to complete:

1. Implement Descriptive Statistics, Correlation  
2. Implement E.D.A, Scatter, and Distributed plots  
3. Implement T-Test and ANOVA  
4. Implement Decision tree and Random Forest Classifications  
5. Implement Support Vector and XG-Boost algorithms  
6. Implement LASSO and RIDGE Regression  
7. Implement Collaborative Filtering  
8. Implement Q-Learning  
9. Implement Support Vector and Gradient Descent Regressions  
10. Implement Decision tree and Random Forest Regressions  

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser  
2. Review the list of data science quests  
3. Click **"Complete"** when you finish an experiment  
4. Watch your XP and level increase  
5. Unlock achievements at 3, 5, 8, and 10 completed quests  
6. Your progress is automatically saved between sessions  

## Technical Details

- Built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
